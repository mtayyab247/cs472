        <h1>Javascript Timer Exercises</h1>
		<p><b>1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
            setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
            setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);
            </b></p>
		<p>In the first line the booyah will be called after 2000ms while in the second line it
             will be called without waiting the 2000ms</p>

        <hr />

        <p><b>2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
            var myfunc = function(a, x) {
             return a * x;
            };
            var x = myfunc(2, 3);
            var y = myfunc;
            alert(x);
            alert(y(2,3)); </b></p>
        <p>Both display 6</p>

        <hr />

        <p><b>3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up
             after 2 seconds that
            says “BOOYAH!”
            setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
            setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);</b></p>
        <p>
            <pre>
                function booyah1() {
                    alert("Booyah1");
                }

                function booyah2() {
                    setTimeout(function() {alert("Booyah2")}, 2000);
                }
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p><b>
            4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
for using it)?
        </b></p>
        <p>Unobtrusive javascript mean we need to separate js from html as much as possible. 
            This will seperate the presentation and the behaviour. It will make our code more cleaner and
            more manageable.<br>
            Also some browsers don't support js so the page will work if js don't run and user won't see
            any errors. Other js files can be imported to js files and used.
