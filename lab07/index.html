        <h1>Javascript Scope Exercises</h1>
		<p>1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
            <pre>
                x = 1;
                var a = 5;
                var b = 10;
                var c = function(a, b, c) {
                    var x = 10;
                    document.write(x);
                    document.write(a);
                    var f = function(a, b, c) {
                        b = a;
                        document.write(b);
                        b = c;
                        var x = 5;
                    }
                    f(a,b,c);
                    
                    document.write(b);
                }
                c(8,9,10);
                document.write(b);
                document.write(x);
                
            </pre>

            <p>output:
                <pre>
                    10
                    8
                    8
                    9
                    10
                    1
                </pre>
            </p>

                <li></li>In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.</li>
                <li></li>In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.</li>
                <li></li>Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object.</li>

                            return c * c;

            <pre>
                function multiply() {
                    var total = 1;
                    for(i in arguments) {

                    }

                (x, y, z) => {
                    let max = Math.max(x, y);
